I either completely jacked Christopher Arnold's book jacket or am paying homage to him and his book, 'Notes on the Synthesis of Form' printed by Harvard University Press.  

He states, "But before we can ourselves turn a problem into form, because we are self-conscious, we need to make explicit maps of the problem's structure, and therefore need first to invent a conceptual framework for such maps."
