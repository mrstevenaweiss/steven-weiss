    <p>The Rules</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
      <li>
        Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
      </li>
    </ol>
